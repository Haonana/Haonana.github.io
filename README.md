# THIS IS MY FIRST MARKDOWN PAGES
## THIS IS SECONDARY TITILE
### THIRD? ALSO CAN BE SEEMED TO A STUDY PAGE
I WANT THIS WORD TO BE **BOILED** AND ALSO *ITALIC*

~~GANG~~:bowtie:

WOULD YOU LIKE A LIST?
1. FIRST POINT
2. SECOND POINT
3. THIRD POINT
AND IT CAN ALSO BE IN UNORDER FORMAT
* POINT
* POINT
  * WITH TWO SPACE CAN BE SECONDARY POINT
  * LIKE THIS
OK, NOW WE WRITE A SMALL SLIP OF CODES(WITH [PYTHON](http://www.baidu.com) LANGUAGE)：

![python](https://image.baidu.com)

‘’‘
if you == 'good man':

    you[paper] == 'sci'
    
else:

    del you  
'''

it also could be inline code 'y=4' like `x = 3`

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

IN THIS PAGE, WE HAVE FOLLOWING FOUR CONTENTS TODO:
- [x] TITLE TO SHOW
- [x] TABLE TABLE TABLE
- [ ] CODE CODE CODE

SO THIS IS THE TABLE:

null|CB513|CULLPDB
--|-----|-------
Q3|0.88|0.35
Q8|0.62|0.44



AT LAST, YOU MAY QUOTE SOME CLASSIC PAPERS AND BOOKS, FOR EXAMPLE:
> A NEW METHOD OF PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION, BIOINFORMATICS, MAY 2018.
